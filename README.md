# CeNCOOS Analysis Data 
 Last Updated: 2/03/2023

**Background Information**

The data sets for this project contain seawater data collected from 2010-2021 (2020 not in use due to the COVID-19 Pandemic) at the Moss Landing shore station managed by Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, and collected with help from CenCOOs (Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System). This is a collaborative effort that “…enables sustained and coordinated measures, model nowcasts and forecasts, and integrated products to inform decisions about our regional ocean."

CeNCOOS Website: https://www.cencoos.org/

These datasets are comprised of: Temperature, Conductivity, Salinity, Chlorophyll Fluorescence, Beam attenuation, Transmission, Dissolved Oxygen, Dissolved Oxygen Saturation, and pH. 

Data are provided by month in comma-separated value (csv) format on the MLML Seawater Intake Public Data Portal.Data Portal with Seawater Intake Historical Text Data:

 September 2010-Present: http://pubdata.mlml.calstate.edu/seawater/index.php. 

Processed quality-controlled data for each year are archived in binary NetCDF format (format currently used in this project). Path and link below. Must request access from Dr. Thomas  Connolly. Github:tompc35

**Sources and Thank You's!**
 
 Thank you to Dr. Tom Connolly, Jason Adelaars, Steven Cunningham, and CeNCOOS for their funding and all others that helped with files and Shore Station Data. 

"The collection and curation of Moss Landing Marine Lab’s (MLML) public data, and the knowledge derived from it, extends the use and value of our research results. Since establishment in 1966, MLML has grown an international reputation for excellence in marine science research and education, and is the second oldest marine lab in the Monterey Bay area. Our public data repositories hold vast quantities of data collected over the course of our 50 year history by Graduate Students, Faculty, and Research Affiliates in subject areas such as Oceanography (CenCOOS, MoBY) and Marine Vertebrate sightings, strandings and mortalities along the Pacific Coast (BeachCOMBERS)."
